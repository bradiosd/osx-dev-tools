# Misc Rules

## Before starting work or debugging

- [ ] Always assume the services are running on the right ports already
- [ ] Hot reloading is enabled so services should pick up changes automatically
- [ ] Use command lsof -i :<port> to check if the app is running if you need to
- [ ] App should run on port 3000
